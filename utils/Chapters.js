      title: "Introduction to Programming",
      content: "Introduction to Programming in C is the first chapter that teaches the basics of computer programming. It covers fundamental concepts like variables, data types, and how to write simple code. You'll learn how to use C to give instructions to a computer, solving problems step by step. This chapter sets the foundation for the rest of your programming journey, helping you create programs that perform tasks and solve real-world problems. It's like learning the alphabet before writing sentences in the language of computers.",

      title: "Fundamentals of C",
      content: "Certainly! The fundamentals of C programming involve learning the basic building blocks of the language. These include variables, which store data, and operations like arithmetic and logical calculations. C also includes control structures like loops and conditional statements for program flow. Functions are essential for organizing code, and libraries provide pre-written functions for various tasks. Lastly, C is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it a popular choice for system-level programming.",

      title: "Operators and Expression",
      content: "Operators in C are symbols or special characters used to perform operations on variables and values. They include arithmetic operators like + (addition) and - (subtraction), comparison operators like == (equality check), and logical operators like && (logical AND). Expressions are combinations of variables, values, and operators that produce a result. For example, 'x + y' is an expression that adds the values of variables x and y. Understanding operators and expressions is fundamental to writing C programs and manipulating data efficiently.",
